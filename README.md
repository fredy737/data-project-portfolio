# Introduction
Portfolio of data science projects showcasing data cleaning, exploration of data, data visualization, and machine learning done through Python and SQL. I aim to tackle problems from a variety of subjects.

# Finding Investment Opportunities From Loan Applications
The aim was to develop a machine learning algorithm that can be used in advising a risk-adverse investor to fund or deny loan applications. I analyzed a dataset of accepted loan applications from 2012 to 2014, and applied the trained machine learning models on a dataset of loan applications from 2015. The results of this project can provide insight to investors regarding the characteristics of borrowers who are likely to pay off their loans.

This project involes data cleaning, feature selection, and application of the logistic regression, random forest, and LightGBM (gradient boosting decision trees) models.

# DataQuest
Selected guided projects from the DataQuest online course. Includes data exploration, data visualization, machine learning algorithms, and querying and creating databases with SQL.
