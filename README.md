# Introduction
Portfolio of data science projects showcasing data cleaning, exploration of data, data visualization, and machine learning done through Python and SQL. I aim to tackle problems from a variety of subjects.

# Finding Investment Opportunities From Loan Applications
The aim was to develop a machine learning algorithm that will help a hypothetical risk-adverse investor decide between funding or rejecting loan applications. I analyzed a dataset of accepted loan applications from 2012 to 2014, and applied the trained machine learning models on a dataset of loan applications from 2015. The results of this project can provide insight to investors regarding the characteristics of borrowers who are likely to pay off their loans.

This project involves data cleaning, feature selection, and application of the logistic regression, random forest, and LightGBM (gradient boosting decision trees) models.

# Wildfire Prevention - Learning From the Past
The exploration of a database of 1.88 million wildfires reported in the United States from 1992 to 2015. The exploration was done with SQL and visualization. The aim was to look at trends and common causes of wildfires across the country and in specific states in order to highlight fire seasons in each state, allowing for strategy making for wildfire prevention.

Future directions include combining the database with a dataset containing temperatures in the United States from 1992 to 2015, and possibly incorporating machine learning for wildfire prediction.

# DataQuest
Selected guided projects from the DataQuest online course. Includes data exploration, data visualization, machine learning algorithms, and querying and creating databases with SQL.
