# Introduction
Portfolio of data science projects showcasing data cleaning, exploration of data, data visualization, and machine learning done through Python and SQL. I aim to tackle problems from a variety of subjects.

# Finding Investment Opportunities From Loan Applications
The aim was to develop analyze and then model a Lending Club dataset containing loan applications from 2015. The resulting machine learning model would help hypothetical investors determine which borrowers would be likely to pay off their loan or default on their loan. 

This project involves data cleaning, feature selection, and application of the logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted decision trees (xgboost).

# Wildfire Prevention - Learning From the Past
The exploration of a database of 1.88 million wildfires reported in the United States from 1992 to 2015. The exploration was done with SQL and visualization. The aim was to look at trends and common causes of wildfires across the country and in specific states in order to highlight fire seasons in each state, allowing for strategy making for wildfire prevention.

A future direction for this project involves combining this wildfire database with Berkeley Earth datasets containing temperatures in the United States. The aim is to incorporate machine learning for wildfire prediction. In preparation for this, we explore temperature time series data in California, analyzing trends and making predictions of changes in average temperatures.

# DataQuest
Selected guided projects from the DataQuest online course. Includes data exploration, data visualization, machine learning algorithms, and querying and creating databases with SQL.
