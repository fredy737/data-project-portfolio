# Overview

The aim of the project was to analyze data from the Lending Club and model the risk profiles of the borrowers with machine learning. We act as if the Lending Club has approached us as a client to help boost their business by automating their loan underwriting process. 

This project provides an analysis on laon applications from 2015. The results of this project can provide insight to investors regarding the characteristics of borrowers who are likely to default on their loans.

This project involves data cleaning, feature selection, and application of the logistic regression, random forest, and xgboost (gradient boosting decision trees) models.
