# Overview

The aim of the project was to develop a machine learning algorithm that will help a hypothetical risk-adverse investor decide between funding or rejecting loan applications. I analyzed a dataset of accepted loan applications from 2012 to 2014, and applied the trained machine learning models on a dataset of loan applications from 2015. The results of this project can provide insight to investors regarding the characteristics of borrowers who are likely to pay off their loans.

This project involves data cleaning, feature selection, and application of the logistic regression, random forest, and LightGBM (gradient boosting decision trees) models.

# Supplemental

In a supplemental study, I studied an unlabeled dataset of loan applications from 2015. K-means clustering was employed. The statistics of the clusters were analyzed.
