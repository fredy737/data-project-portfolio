# Overview
This project includes the exploration of a database of 1.88 million wildfires reported in the United States from 1992 to 2015. We note the trends and common causes of wildfires across the country and in specific states, allowing for strategy making for wildfire prevention.

We are interested in the wildfires in California, as we found that many of the devastating wildfires were human-caused. We are also interested in linking the degree of wildfire devastation and the trends in temperatures in California. With that in mind, we have explored datasets of monthly temperatures in California, obtained from the Berkeley Earth project. Trends and seasonalities were analyzed in these time series, and attempts were made to predict monthly temperatures in California.

A future direction involves combining the Berkeley datasets with the wildfire database to make predictions about wildfire devastation in California.
